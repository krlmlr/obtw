Oh, by the way: the goal of this package is to offer a set of lightweight tools to simplify data checks in a pipeline.

This package provides two convenience features for working with data transformation pipelines:

- A stack, for pushing the current result and retrieving it for later use

- A validation framework, for reporting multiple failures in a pipeline


## Installation

You can install the development version of obtw like so:

``` r
pak::pak("krlmlr/obtw")
```

(Follow the [installation instructions](https://pak.r-lib.org/#arrow_down-installation) to install pak.)

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(obtw)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
